# AVL-Tree-Implementation
This project implements an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, in C++. The AVL tree ensures balance by maintaining the height difference between left and right subtrees to a maximum of 1 using left rotations and right rotations during insertion and deletion operations.
